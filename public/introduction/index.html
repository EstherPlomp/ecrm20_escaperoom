I&rsquo;ll be your host in this game. We are currently in the year 2118 and all research is published with no costs for readers or authors. This is called Diamond Open Access. Back in 2020 it was different, and making research available for free could be… well, expensive or time consuming. You’re probably wondering why I’ve invited you here.

<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Robin!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be your host in this game. We are currently in the year 2118 and all research is published with no costs for readers or authors. This is called Diamond Open Access. Back in 2020 it was different, and making research available for free could be… well, expensive or time consuming. You’re probably wondering why I’ve invited you here. As supporters of Open Access, I need your help. The villain, Dr. Springer, has locked away all research here at NORMENT. Your task is to unlock the research and make everything free to …</p>
<h3 id="dr-springer">Dr. Springer:</h3>
<p><img src="/images/villain-standing.png" alt=""></p>
<p>FREE?! What about me? What am I supposed to live off? I am the KING/QUEEN of knowledge – hence the crown. I can distribute the research I’ve locked down to all of you… for a small price. Making everything open was a huge mistake. Nothing is controlled anymore. Anyone can read about anything with no filter. Nobody is making any money. Look at this, hardly anything left! (*points to large piggy bank filled to the brim with large coins*) I will shut EVERYTHING down. Not just the research at NORMENT. EVERYTHING!! Then I will make you pay. MUHAHAHA</p>
<h3 id="robin-1">Robin:</h3>
<p>Oh dear… You must stop the villain before he locks down everything! There is a rumour that there are two ways to making everything open again; the Green and the Gold Route. You must choose one!</p>
