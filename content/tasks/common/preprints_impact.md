_So I hope you've managed to calculate the median number of download for these journals and get the impact factor!_

_If you visualized the data, you might have seen something like the plot below. There is a really strong relationship between number of downloads of a preprint and the impact factor of the journal. Now, this may be a bit of a chicken-and-egg story. I'm not sure whether articles eventually published in a high-impact journal will get more downloads on their preprint, or whether preprints who have been very popular before being published are more likely to be published in a high-impact journal? Now, you may have a think about this with your group for a few minutes before you move on._
