Welcome to the Open Access Escape Room. An escape room is a physical adventure game where you will attempt to solve a series of puzzles and riddles using clues, hints and strategy to ‘escape’ the room. 

In our version we will not lock the room, but the game will finish when you complete the last task in the last item you unlock. The game will be linear, meaning once you’ve completed one puzzle and unlocked an item you will get a clue to the next puzzle. However, you might happen to stumble upon some clues for later puzzles whilst looking around in the room. If you do, it is best if you make a note of what it was and where you found it and continue with the puzzle you were working on. You can follow parallel paths if you stumble upon a clue you weren’t meant to find yet, and therefore work on several puzzles at once, but it is easier if you concentrate on one puzzle at a time.

If you get stuck or ask for a clue we will give you a hint in the chat. You have 45 minutes to complete all the tasks. The game will start when you first make a choice. This might not make much sense now, but it will soon…  Is everything clear?
