Welcome to the Open Access Escape Room. An escape room is a physical adventure game where you will attempt to solve a series of puzzles and riddles using clues, hints and strategy to "escape" the room. 

In our version we will not lock the room, but the game will finish when you complete the last task in the last item you unlock. The game will be linear, meaning once you've completed one puzzle and unlocked an item you will get a clue to the next puzzle. However, you might happen to stumble upon some clues for later puzzles whilst looking around in the room. If you do, it is best if you make a note of what it was and where you found it and continue with the puzzle you were working on. You can follow parallel paths if you stumble upon a clue you werenâ€™t meant to find yet, and therefore work on several puzzles at once, but it is easier if you concentrate on one puzzle at a time.

If you get stuck or ask for a clue we will give you a hint in the chat. You have 45 minutes to complete all the tasks. The game will start when you first make a choice. This might not make much sense now, but it will soonâ€¦  Is everything clear?

### Images, buttons, and links

Throughout the site, you'll find different buttons, icons, and images and gifs. Some of them are clickable, some are not! You'll have seen the button to start the game above, and the button below for instance links to the current page. Buttons like the one below (with the work "Go" in the green box) will guide you through the story, make sure to follow them! Occasionally, images, emojis, and gifs are clickable too! So keep an eye out! ðŸ˜‰

The menu will always be visible below. Here you can go back to start, read the instructions, and go to a list of all the tasks if you're lost. In the "about" page, you can read information about the website and the concept. In the "tasks" menu, you can also jump ahead, but that would be cheating, and we hope we don't have any cheaters here?
