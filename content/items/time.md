_What is it? Canâ€™t you see I am busy? Okay, letâ€™s play a game._

_Pick a number between 1 and 5..._

<br>
<br>

_Do you have one?_

_Now pick another number between 20 and 60..._

<br>
<br>

_Okay, now multiply those two._

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

_Since you picked the Green route, you have to submit to my embargo! That means that you have to wait a while before you can continue! Remember the multiplication I made you do? That's the number of seconds you have to wait before you may continue. MUHAHAHA \* Runs away to count his money \*_

If you need something to do while waiting for the embargo to be over, you may skim through [this article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6400415/) discussing the advantages of preprints for Early-Career Reseachers.
