_Maybe it's time you talk to the villain again..._

### Dr. Springer:

_What is it? Canâ€™t you see I am busy? Okay, letâ€™s play a game._

_Pick a number between 1 and 5..._

&nbsp;

_Do you have one?_

&nbsp;

_Pick another number between 20 and 60..._

&nbsp;

_Okay, now multiply those two._

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_Since you picked the Green route, you have to submit to my embargo! That means that you have to wait a while before you can continue! Remember the multiplication I made you do? That's the number of seconds you have to wait before you may continue. MUHAHAHA \* Runs away to count his money \*_ 

&nbsp;

If you need something to do while waiting for the embargo to be over, you may skim through [this article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6400415/) discussing the advantages of preprints for Early-Career Reseachers.

_It seems like Dr. Springer dropped something when he ran away, it's a piece of paper:_

> ***MONEY***
>
> ***PREDATORY***
>
> ***PAPERS***

_Maybe these are clues that you can use when you continue with your tasks after the embargo is over?_
